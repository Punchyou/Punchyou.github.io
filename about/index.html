I've been through many professional changes, mainly because I have found difficult to decide what I want to do, as there are too many things that I love. <br/> I started with studying music since I was a kid, mainly classical piano, but also tried guitar, flute and even modern vocals and music production a bit later in my life, but I haven't been an active musician since 2013. I used to be curious as a teenager about our world and the universe and I used love physics (don't get me wrong, I still do) so I decided to study physics and got my bachelor from University of Ioannina in Greece in 2015. I also wanted to combine my analytical and numerical skills I gained from my degree along with my artistic background and in the same time upgrade my skills in programming, so I got a Digital Arts Master's degree from Audio and Visual Department in Corfu, Greece in 2018. I had an amazing educational experience during my time there, most of my classes were heavilly technical and that was when I first discovered (real) coding and fell in love with it. Before I graduate, I worked as a researcher at the Music Studies Department of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. I worked with the music informatics team of the department and we created a musical tool that performs an automatic harmonic analysis from a music sheet. That's when I discovered the world of data and their visualization and (guess what) I also feel in love with it! <br/> During my studies, I used to work as a waitress, sales advisor and a private tutor to support my studies. By the time I graduated with my master's, I knew I wanted to go after a professional career as a developer and work with data analysis and modeling, so I moved to London to pursue that. I joined ARM in 2019 as a junior software developer and now I'm working with one of the predictive modeling teams of the company. <br/> <br/> <h2 align="center">Things I’m working on now</h2> Currently in my team we develop forecasting models for the bussiness. My main job is to explore and model timeseries data through statistical modelling, machine learning and AI and to build forecasting models and their visualizations. As it's a relatively new team, I've been lucky enough to be responsible for building our engineering DevOps pipelines, explore code quality testing teckniques and also being involved in finding our ways of work as a team. <br/> On my free time, I'm learning more about Machine Learning and computer science concepts. I am also a gamer, so from time to time I upload stories of interesting things I discover in my favorite games! I recently started learning how to build my own games, so hopefully I'll publish my first games soon! <br/> <h2 align="center">Why this blog?</h2> I decided to upload some of the things I like and learn as it keeps me motivated to learn more and also I have a universal place to store my notes, documentations and stories I'd like to share. <br/> <br/> </font> <h5> I’m relatively new to the world of software engineering, data and blogging, so I’d appreciate your feedback and your love! </h5> </p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <footer> <p> Powered by<a href="https://github.com/sujaykundu777/devlopr-jekyll"> devlopr jekyll</a>.
