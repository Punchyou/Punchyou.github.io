                        <font size="4">
                            My name is Maria and I work as a software developer at ARM in Cambridge.
                            I've been through many professional changes, mainly because of my difficulty in deciding what I want to do, as there are too many things that I love. 
                        <br/>
                        I've studied music since I was a kid, mainly classical piano, but also tried guitar, flute, modern vocals and even music production a bit later, but I haven't been an active musician since then. I used to be curious as a teenager about our world and universe and I loved physics (don't get me wrong, I still do) so I got a physics degree from University of Ioannina in Greece. I also wanted to combine my analytical and numerical skills along with my artistic background, so I got a Digital Arts Master's degree from Audio and Visual Department in Corfu, Greece. Most of my classes there were heavilly technical and that was when I first discovered (real) coding and fell in love with it. Before I graduate with my master's, I worked as a researcher at the Music Studies Department of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. I worked with the music informatics team of the Department and we created a musical application that performs an automatic harmonic analysis from a music sheet. That's when I discovered the world of data and their visualization and (guess what) I also feel in love with it!
                            <br/>
                            By the time I graduated I knew I wanted to go after a professional career as a developer, so I moved to London in 2018 and in September 2019 I joined ARM as a junior software developer. At the moment I love what I do, and I think I'll stick to it for a while!

                    <h2 align="center">Things I’m working on now</h2>
                            Currently I'm working with the forecasting team of ARM and we develop forecasting models for the bussiness. We're investigating exciting things like statistical modelling, machine learning and AI, timeseries forecasting and data visualization methods. As it's a relatively new team, I am lucky enough to also contribute on building our engineering pipelines and finding our ways of work as a team.                            
                            <br/>
                            On my free time, I'm learning more about Deep Learning and general computer science concepts. I am also a gamer, so from time to time I upload to stories of what I discover in my favorite games!
                            <br/>
                            Some of the technologies I'm enthusiastic about and I've been using for both my work and personal projects are Python, NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, plotly in Python, seaborn, R and plotly in R.
                            <br/>

                    <h2 align="center">Why this blog?</h2>                      
                            I decided to upload some of the things I like and learn as it keeps me motivated to learn more and also I have a universal place to store my notes, documentations and stories I'd like to share.
