# Feature Selection Algorithms
*This article is about selecting the best set of features for your model. I did some research on this topic and ended up finding really interesting resources that mention different algotihms or a compination of some of them to create a robust feature selection tool. Take a look on what I've found:*


# Why Feature Selection?
1. **When having too many features the model overfits due to the curse of dimentionality.** If we have more columns in the data than the number of rows, we will be able to fit our training data perfectly, but that wonâ€™t generalize to the new samples. And thus we learn absolutely nothing.
